# IsoGame \[C\]
This project is about re-creating a rendering dmo I made in Java where I rendered an isometric level with software rendering.

With this project, I'm working in C under windows. *[You may have seen my other project where I made this in x64 Assembly](https://github.com/Kirdow/IsoGameAsm)*.

In order to build you would need Visual Studio 2022 installed (others may be compatible), then open `x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022` and navigate to the repository directory. Then run `build.bat` to build and `run.bat` to run.

I can't guarantee it will work flawlessly, this is merely a backup of my code.

Enjoy.
